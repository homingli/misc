From me, an outside techie, looking in on the education industry...

###To the EdTech nation,###

Education is imperative to shaping a better world, and I want to contribute to better this changing world. I’m eagerly looking for an opportunity to participate in the EdTech industry to revolutionize the world for our kids, our kids’ kids, and their kids, and [to infinity and beyond](http://pixar.wikia.com/To_Infinity_and_Beyond).

I really enjoy [the TED talks by Sir Ken Robinson](http://www.ted.com/speakers/sir_ken_robinson.html), always so inspiring. I, too, agree with the need for a revolution to break out of linearity and conformity, the "fast-food" standardization in Education. Not only is the TED talk a true inspiration, more so it _provoked_ me to reflect on my own experiences. I came to my own conclusion that many existing education program and platforms have immense room for improvement. __I believe we can do better__. While I understand that the education system difficult to change, and especially unwilling to change if existing methods are considered "good enough",  I strongly advocate the need for change, to keep up, and to propel forward.
> To adapt to this changing world, evolution is a must.

From the evolution, we begin a revolution. This beginning is also a great opportunity for me to live by Ms Frizzle’s famous quote: ["Take chances. Make mistakes."](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/The_Magic_School_Bus) Here, I am ready to _take the chance_ to reach out to all of you with hope to take control and drive our mutual vision towards a better educated future. As Mr Robinson had said, “everybody has vested interest in education”. I want to take my interest a step further and make a difference towards this otherwise unpredictable future.

Living in the world of technology, I envision leveraging these aspects of modern technology for education:

  - [Real time communication](http://searchunifiedcommunications.techtarget.com/definition/real-time-communications) (near-instant feedback systems).
  - Available everywhere (accessibility to resources).
  - [Long term data retention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_retention) (record keeping).
  - [Thorough data analysis](http://hackeducation.com/2012/12/09/top-ed-tech-trends-of-2012-education-data-and-learning-analytics/) (better prediction/trending).

There's the technical problem, and then there's the psychological pattern issues.

* How do we make education more engaging?
* How do we best allow learning to take it's organic course?
* How to put urgency and priority in the students with a growing list of worries?
* How to win over timeshare alongside Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat?

__I don't have the answer, but I'd like to find out with you.__ I feel that this is my calling to make an impact. My past made me who I am today. Technology, education, and youth, a perfect mix to contribute my time to. I am a scout leader and a technologist. I have always enjoyed working with kids. I have long searched for a possibility and an opportunity to embrace my passion to fuel my day to day work. This would be it.

Here comes the next big wave, the EdTech innovation. Evolution has begun, everything from [Clever](https://getclever.com/) to [Knewton](http://www.knewton.com/) to [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/), and even the big boys [Apple](http://www.apple.com/education/) and [Google](http://www.google.ca/edu/) are at it. My intentions are clear, I’m looking to get involved. I’m a tech generalist passionate about leveraging the edtech industry to build a better future. So please help me help the world. Help me, help you, to help us all change the world.

With _passion_,
